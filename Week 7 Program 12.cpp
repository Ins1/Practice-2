/*********************************************************************
	Stats Class and Track Statistics

	Write a client program that uses the Stats class you created for Programming Challenge 9 to  store
	and  analyze  “best” 100-yard dash  times  for  each  of the  15  runners  on  a track team. As in
	Programming Challenge 8, all I/O is done by the client program. In addition to main, the client
	program should  have two  other  functions:  a getData function  to accept input  from  the  user
	and  send  it to the Stats object  and  a createReport function  that creates and displays a report
	similar to the one shown here,

	Tulsa Tigers Track Team
	Average 100 yard-dash time: 11.16 seconds 
	Slowest runner: Jack        13.09 seconds 
	Fastest runner: Will        10.82 seconds
