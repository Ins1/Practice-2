/*********************************************************************
	Final Project

	You will be writing a Library simulator. It will have three classes: Book, Patron and Library. 
	To make things a little simpler for you, I am supplying you with the three .hpp files. 
	You will write the three implementation files. You may add one-line "inline function" implementations 
	to the .hpp files if you want, but implementation of the other functions should go in the corresponding .cpp files. 
	Please put your function comments in the .cpp files (they would clutter up the .hpp files).
