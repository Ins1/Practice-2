	Moving  Inchworm

	Write a program that displays an inchworm on the left-hand  side of the screen, facing right. Then 
	slowly move him across the screen, until he disappears  off the right-hand side. You may wish to do 
	this in a loop so that  after disappearing to the right, the worm  appears  again on
	the left. The diagram  below shows how he may look at various points on the screen.
